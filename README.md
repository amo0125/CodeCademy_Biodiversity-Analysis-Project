  <h1>Biodiversity Analysis Project</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This project analyzes biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, specifically focusing on various species observed in different national park locations. The main goal of the project is to scope, analyze, prepare, and plot the data to explain the findings. The project seeks to answer the following key questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the distribution of conservation status for species?</li>
    <li>Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?</li>
    <li>Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?</li>
    <li>Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution among parks?</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Data Sources</h2>
  <p>The data for this project is provided by Codecademy.com and consists of two CSV files:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Observations.csv: Contains information about species observations in national parks, including species names, park locations, and observation counts.</li>
    <li>Species_info.csv: Provides details about the species, including names, conservation status, and additional categorical information.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: The data for this project is inspired by real data, but is mostly fictional.</p>
  <h2>Scoping</h2>
  <p>Before starting the project, it is important to define the project scope. The following sections outline the project goals, data analysis, methods, and evaluation.</p>
  <h3>Project Goals</h3>
  <p>The main objective of the project is to understand the characteristics of species and their conservation status, as well as their relationship to the national parks. The project aims to answer the following questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the distribution of conservation status for species?</li>
    <li>Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?</li>
    <li>Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?</li>
    <li>Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution among parks?</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Data</h3>
  <p>The project utilizes two provided data sets: Observations.csv and Species_info.csv. Observations.csv contains information about each species' observations in different parks, while Species_info.csv provides details about the species' characteristics, including their conservation status.</p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p>The analysis involves descriptive statistics, data visualization, and statistical inference to gain insights from the data. Key metrics computed include distributions, counts, and the relationship between species and their conservation status. Additionally, the observations of species in parks will be analyzed.</p>
  <h3>Evaluation</h3>
  <p>In this section, the project goals are revisited, and the analysis findings are evaluated against the initial questions. Limitations and alternative methodologies are also discussed, highlighting what has been learned throughout the project.</p>
