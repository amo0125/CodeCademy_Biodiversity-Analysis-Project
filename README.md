# CodeCademy_Biodiversity-Analysis-Project

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This project analyzes biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, specifically focusing on various species observed in different national park locations. The main goal of the project is to scope, analyze, prepare, and plot the data to explain the findings. The project seeks to answer the following key questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the distribution of conservation status for species?</li>
    <li>Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?</li>
    <li>Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?</li>
    <li>Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution among parks?</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Data Sources</h2>
  <p>The data for this project is provided by Codecademy.com and consists of two CSV files:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Observations.csv: Contains information about species observations in national parks, including species names, park locations, and observation counts.</li>
    <li>Species_info.csv: Provides details about the species, including names, conservation status, and additional categorical information.</li>
  </ul>
